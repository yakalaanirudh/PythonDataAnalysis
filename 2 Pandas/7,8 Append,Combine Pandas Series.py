"""
append()
Used for: Concatenating DataFrames by stacking them vertically (row-wise).
Similar to: pd.concat([df1, df2])
Deprecated: Since pandas 1.4.0, .append() has been deprecated, and it's recommended to use pd.concat() instead.
Behavior:
Adds rows from one DataFrame to another.
Does not modify the original DataFrame unless inplace=True (which was removed in pandas 1.4.0).
If column names donâ€™t match, missing values (NaN) are introduced.

combine()
Used for: Merging two DataFrames element-wise using a custom function.
Behavior:
Applies a function element-wise to resolve conflicts when combining two DataFrames.
Works best for updating an existing DataFrame with new values.
